This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in Perl related to the iteration order of hashes.  Perl's hash iteration order is not guaranteed to be consistent, leading to unexpected results if you rely on a specific order. This example shows how to mitigate this behavior if a specific order is crucial for your application.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problem, and `bugSolution.pl` presents a solution that addresses the issue by explicitly sorting the keys before iteration.
